# RK356x bare-metal support

The RK356x platform supports three explicit boards:

- [Firefly ROC-RK3566-PC](boards/roc3566.md)
- [Youyeetoo YY3568](boards/yy3568.md)
- [Radxa ROCK 3A](boards/rock3a.md)

Shared SoC code initializes DDR discovery, UART2 M0, the RK356x memory map,
VOP2, HDMI, USB2 OHCI and the existing firmware-call interface. Board files
contain only identity and wiring such as LEDs, USB host power and enabled OHCI
companions. This does not claim support for arbitrary RK3566 or RK3568 boards.

The boot flow remains the same bare-metal model used elsewhere in this project:

```text
RK356x BootROM -> Rockchip DDR blob -> rk firmware -> appended EL2 payload
```

Normal firmware artifacts require a compatible payload appended after the
firmware image. Demo artifacts already contain the repository's example
payload and are the appropriate standalone hardware test.

## Common behavior

- UART2 M0 runs at 1,500,000 baud, 8N1.
- HDMI is initialized unconditionally with a fixed 1920x1080p60 RGB mode.
- HPD probing, EDID/DDC mode selection, and runtime hotplug are not used.
- Enabled USB2 OHCI ports poll directly attached HID boot keyboards.
- `FU_GET_CHAR` and `FU_POLL_CHAR` expose keyboard input to the payload.
- Reset and shutdown firmware calls return the SoC to MaskROM.

USB hubs, high-speed host controllers, runtime display hotplug and storage
access are outside the RK356x firmware implementation.

## Memory layout

| Range | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `0x00a00000` | Relocated EL2 payload |
| `0x07ff0000-0x08000000` | EL3 and EL2 stacks |
| `0x08000000-0x08400000` | Non-cacheable OHCI, DTB and firmware exchange area |
| `0x10000000-0x12000000` | Non-cacheable framebuffer arena |
| `0xf0000000-0xffffffff` | Device-mapped MMIO |

PMUGRF geometry is the physical-capacity authority. A validated DDR ATAG is
used for bank topology only when its ranges agree with that capacity; otherwise
the firmware synthesizes a conservative topology from PMUGRF. It falls back to
1 GiB only when both sources are invalid. `FU_GET_MEM_MAP` includes validated
RAM banks above 4 GiB, while `FU_GET_MEM_CHUNK` remains below 4 GiB.

Before display initialization, UART logs show the DRAM source, physical byte
count, bank count, and normalized ranges. The implementation and its source
and license boundaries are detailed in [RK356x source
provenance](references.md). The 64-bit output is implemented in
`src/rk356x/log.c`; repository-wide formatting and other SoC targets remain
unchanged.

## Artifacts and loading

Build every existing and RK356x target with:

```sh
make all
```

For a first test, load the board's demo directly into RAM:

```sh
make usb_roc3566
make usb_yy3568
make usb_rock3a
```

After the board has been placed in MaskROM with its hardware recovery control,
the optional SoC-level xrock USB-plug helpers are:

```sh
make maskrom3566
make maskrom3568
```

`maskrom3566` uses the RK3566 DDR blob. `maskrom3568` is shared by the two
supported RK3568 boards. These helpers upload the USB-plug loader; they are not
a prerequisite for the direct `usb_<board>` flow. Direct firmware loading must
use the board-qualified target so board wiring cannot be selected by SoC name
alone.

Alternatively, write the corresponding `demo_<board>.img` to a complete SD
device. The normal `<board>.img` contains firmware only and still requires an
appended payload.
